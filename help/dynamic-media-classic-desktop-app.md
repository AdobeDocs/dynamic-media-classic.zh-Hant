# Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app {#dynamic-media-classic-desktop-app}

Dynamic Media Classic users now have access to a new desktop app experience that no longer relies on Adobe Flash technology in the browser. 

This new app is now available for Windows and macOS.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>We recommend that you install the new Adobe Dynamic Media Classic desktop app by October 1, 2020. Doing so will ensure you have a smooth transition before Adobe Flash Player is deprecated on December 31, 2020. On that date, you will no longer be able to log on to the browser version of Adobe Dynamic Media Classic user interface, labeled as Scene7 Publishing System in the product.

See the FAQ for the [New Dynamic Media Classic sign in experience now available](/help/new-ui-2020.md).

## Tips and Tricks 

**_I am unable to see Media Cart panel on the landing page of Dynamic Media Classic._**<br>In Dynamic Media Classic, tap **[!UICONTROL Setup > Personal Setup]**. In the Browser section, make sure **[!UICONTROL Show MediaPortal Features]** is selected (checked). Tap **[!UICONTROL Save > Close]**.
 
**_Publish state (green indicator) of an asset is not reflected correctly._**<br>In the browser UI, a re-login to the UI was required to see the correct publish state of assets. In the desktop app, we have introduced a **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** icon on the toolbar, to the right of the **[!UICONTROL Select None]** button. Tap the **[!UICONTROL Refresh]** icon to see the latest status of all the assets on the given page. No re-login required as with the browser UI.

![Refresh icon](/help/assets/refresh-icon.png)
*Refresh icon*
 
**_I don't see batch set presets working in the desktop app._**<br>Tap **[!UICONTROL Upload > Job Options > Batch Set Presets]**. Ensure the relevant **[!UICONTROL Batch Set Preset]** is enabled. Click **[!UICONTROL Save and Submit upload]**.
